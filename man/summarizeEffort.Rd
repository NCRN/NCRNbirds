\usage{
summarizeEffort(object, byYear = T, byPoint = F, effort = "points", wide = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{NCRNbirds} object or a \code{list} of such objects.}

\item{byYear}{Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Indicates if data should be separated by year (\code{TRUE}) or combined (\code{FALSE})}

\item{byPoint}{Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Indicates if data should be separated by point (\code{TRUE}) or combined (\code{FALSE})}

\item{effort}{Indicates if effort should be measured by "points" (# of points visited) or "visits" (total # of visits).}

\item{wide}{Defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} and \code{wide} is \code{TRUE} then there will be a column for each year and row for each park 
or point. Otherwise there will be a single \code{Year} column to indicate the year.}

\item{parks}{A character vector of park codes. Only visits within these parks will be returned.}

\item{points}{A character vector. The names of one or more points where the data was collected.}

\item{AOU}{A character vector. One or more AOU (American Onothological Union) codes of bird species.}

\item{years}{A vector of numbers. Will return only data from the indicated years.}

\item{times}{A numeric vector of length 1 passed on to \code{\link{getVisits}}. Returns only data from points where the number of years that a point has 
been visited is greater or equal to the value of \code{times}. This is determined based on the data found in the \code{Visits} slot.}

\item{band}{A numeric vector. Defaults to 1. Only observations whose \code{Distance_id} field matches a value in \code{band} will be returned.}

\item{visits}{The visits that will be used for the matrix. Defaults to \code{NA}. See Details below.}

\item{max}{Logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} then the matrix will also include a single column with the maximum detections seen at 
each point across all the visits specified in the \code{visits} argument.}

\item{type}{Either "count", the default of "occupancy". Determines the type of data in the matrix. If "count" then each number will represent the
number of birds observed. If "occupancy" then the data will be 1 if one or more birds is observed, and 0 otherwise.}

\item{site}{Character. Select sites in "Forest" or "Grassland" habitats. Defaults to selecting both site types.}

\item{dist}{Character. Filter data by disturbance code(s). See network documentation for list and meanings of codes.}

\item{wind}{Numeric. Filter data by wind code(s). See network documentation for list and meanings of codes.}

\item{sky}{Numeric. Filter data by sky condition code(s). See network documentation for list and meanings of codes.}

\item{output}{Either "dataframe" (the default) or "list". Note that this must be in quotes. Determines the type of output from the function.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{getBirds}}
}
\description{
Produces a table indicating how many visits were made to parks and points.
}
\details{
This produces a Count X Visit matrix for a \code{NCRNbirds} object or a \code{list} of such objects. Each row of the matrix
 will correspond to a different point in a different year. The columns of the matrix will be the park code, the point name, the year 
 visited, and a column of abundances of the indcated species at that visit. If multiple species are indicated in \code{AOU}, their 
 abundances will be totaled. If \code{max=T} then the maximum accross all visits will be returned as well as the indvidual visit totals.
 
 If \code{visits} is left as \code{NA} then the visits used will be 1 through the number of visits indicated in the \code{visits} slot. 
 Otherwise a numeric vectore e.g. c(1,2) can be used to select which visits are used. 
 
 If \code{type} is set as "occupancy" the the matix will have 1 for visits where a site is occuped and 0 forvisits where it is unoccupied rather than 
 abundances.
