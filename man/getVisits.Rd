\item{object}{An \code{NCRNbirds} object or a list of such objects.}

\item{times}{A numeric vector of length 1. Returns only data from points where the number of years that a point has been vistied is greater or equal to the value of \code{times}. This is determined based on the data found in the \code{Visits} slot.}

\item{years}{A numeric vector. Returns data only from points where the years the point was visited  matches one of the values in \code{years} The year a visit takes place is determined by the \code{Year} column in the \code{visits} slot which is dervied from the imformation in the \code{Date} column.}

\description{
Returns the contents of the \code{Visits} slot of an NCRNbirds object. The returned data can be filtered to meet various criteria.
}
\details{
This function returns point data either from a single NCRNbirds object or a list of such objects. The default output is a\code{data.frame}. However, if \code{object} is a list and \code{output} is "list" then a list of \code{data.frame}s will be returned. The name of each element in this list will correspond to the \code{ParkCode} in each NCRNbirds object.
